# -Real-Time-Crowd-Analysis-for-Resource-Management-Using-YOLOv8
A real-time AI-powered system for detecting and analyzing crowds using drone camera feeds and images. This project uses a YOLOv8 object detection model to count people from video streams and static images, visualize crowd density using a grid approach, and log data periodically for further analysis and resource allocation.
